# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing React dashboard into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities, improved styling, and better user experience. The implementation will include service worker registration, manifest configuration, caching strategies for the Open Meteo API, and UI improvements to reposition the chart below the metrics display.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to be installable as a PWA so that I can access it like a native app on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the dashboard THEN the browser SHALL offer the option to install the app
2. WHEN the user installs the PWA THEN the app SHALL appear with custom icons on their device
3. WHEN the user opens the installed PWA THEN it SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
4. IF the PWA is installed THEN the manifest SHALL include proper app metadata and icons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to work offline so that I can view previously loaded weather data even without internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads weather data with internet connection THEN the data SHALL be cached locally
2. WHEN the user accesses the app without internet connection THEN previously cached data SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN API requests are made offline THEN the service worker SHALL serve cached responses
4. IF cached data exists THEN the app SHALL function normally without network connectivity
5. WHEN cached data expires THEN fresh data SHALL be fetched when connection is restored

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved visual layout so that the chart appears below the metrics for better data comprehension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN metrics SHALL be displayed at the top of the interface
2. WHEN metrics are shown THEN the chart SHALL be positioned below the metrics section
3. WHEN the layout renders THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL be clear and intuitive
4. IF the screen size changes THEN the layout SHALL remain responsive and well-organized

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper PWA configuration so that the app meets PWA standards and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN a service worker SHALL be automatically generated and registered
2. WHEN the manifest is created THEN it SHALL include all required PWA properties
3. WHEN icons are configured THEN they SHALL support multiple sizes and purposes (including maskable)
4. IF the app is audited THEN it SHALL meet PWA criteria for installability and performance
5. WHEN the service worker updates THEN it SHALL automatically update without user intervention

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to cache API responses intelligently so that data loads quickly and works offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL use NetworkFirst caching strategy
2. WHEN responses are cached THEN they SHALL expire after 24 hours
3. WHEN cache storage is full THEN old entries SHALL be automatically removed (max 10 entries)
4. IF API responses have successful status codes THEN they SHALL be cached
5. WHEN offline THEN cached API responses SHALL be served immediately
